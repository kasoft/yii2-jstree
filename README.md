    'jsonUrl' => '/my_jsonurl/data/whatever',
]);
```

```html
<div id="jstree"></div>
```


Usage with Yii2 Model 
-----
If you want to use the Extension so Display the Tree from your Data, do Operations
like move, create, delete, rename and open the form view by Click use this Version.

Before you start, check your Database or your Model! Do you have all required Fields?

Together with a Database (tested with MySQL) and a set of Fields to order and
structure the tree are needed. The Tree is displayed in a DIV. The Extensions handels 
create, move, rename and delete for you. A click on a Tree Item will dipslay the form to
edith data in another div. 

See the Test Setup in the "demo" Folder! 

Set up you Database with the needed fileds (can have different names)
*name            Name or Titel to Display in in the tree (required)
*parent_id       Id for nesting the tree (required)
*position        For sorting the tree items (required)
*type            Type of the Item, used for Icon and rights (optional)

Set up your Model with these Fields. Important: Only the name is allwoed to be
a required Field! Otherwise the Contextmenue "New" will probably not work.


Add this to your Controller. All Items with (*) are required!

```php
<?
public function actionIndex() {
        $tree = new \kasoft\jstree\JsTree([
            'modelName'=>'backend\models\MY_MODEL_NAME',    // * Namespace of the Model
            'modelPropertyId' => 'id'                       // * primary Key
            'modelPropertyParentId' => 'parentId',          // * Parent ID for tree items
            'modelPropertyPosition' => 'position',          // *for sorting items
            'modelPropertyName' => 'name',                  // * Fieldname to show
            'modelFirstParentId' => NULL,                   // * ID for the Tree to start
            'modelPropertyType' => 'type',                  // Item type (for Icon and jsTree rights)
            'controllerId' => 'index',                      // Controler Actions which should handle everything
            'jstreeDiv' => '#jstree',                       // DIV where the Tree will be displayed
            'jstreeIcons' => false,                         // Show Icons or not
            'jstreePlugins' => ["contextmenu", "dnd",..],   // Plugins to be load
            'jstreeContextMenue' => [                       // Define individual menu
                "remove" => [
                    "text" => "Delete",
                    "icon" => "glyphicon glyphicon-plane",
                ],
                "edit" => [
                    "text" => "Edit",
                    "icon" => "glyphicon glyphicon-picture",
                ],
                "create" => [
                    "text" => "Create new",
                    "icon" => "glyphicon glyphicon-barcode",
                    "type"=> "online",
                    "submenu" => [                          //Define submenu for creating node types
                        ["text"=>"Create new with Type offline","icon" => "glyphicon glyphicon-barcode","type"=>"offline"],
                        ["text"=>"Create new with Type online","icon" => "glyphicon glyphicon-plane", "type"=>"online"],
                        ["text"=>"Create new with Type default","glyphicon glyphicon-volume-up","type"=>""],
                    ]
                ],
                "rename" => [
                    "text" => "Rename",
                    "icon" => "glyphicon glyphicon-volume-up",
                ],
            ],
            'jstreeType' => [                               // jsTree Type Options
                "#" => [
                    "max_children" => -1,
                    "max_depth" => -1,
                    "valid_children" => -1, 
                    "icon" => "glyphicon glyphicon-th-list"
                ],
                "default" => [
                    "icon" => "glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"
                ],
            ],
            'jstreeMsg' => [                                // Individual Alert Messages
                    "confirmdelete" => "Are you sure? Delete?",
                    "nothere" => "Not possible at this Position!",
                ]
        ]);
        
        return $this->render('index');
    }
 ?>
```

Put this in the index view file. A Click on an Item will delegate the update
action to the result field. Also the form should have a class named "jstree-form"
to delegate the result of the form submit to the div.

```html
<div id="jstree"></div>
<div class="result"></div>
```
